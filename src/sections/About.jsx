        <p className="mb-4">Hi! My name is Yash Sawhney — a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying Computer Science and Economics in the Commonwealth Honors College.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">What I'm actually passionate about is the real-world application of technology, especially within the financial sector. I'm fascinated by how computer science can be used to build smarter systems, uncover insights, and drive better decision-making in finance.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">That's why I'm drawn to product — not just designing what people use, but understanding how it works under the hood. I want to help create tools and software that are both powerful and practical, combining technical depth with user-first thinking.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">When I'm not coding or deep in classwork, you'll usually find me outside — hiking, playing basketball, taking photos, or exploring new places (Barcelona is next on my bucket list!).</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
